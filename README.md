Dry and Wet Waste Segregation – Python Project

This project is a simple Python program that classifies waste into *Dry Waste* and *Wet Waste* based on user input.  
It helps demonstrate basic Python programming concepts such as conditional statements, user input handling, and text-based decision logic.

## 🌱 Project Purpose
The main objective of this project is to promote awareness about proper waste segregation by providing a small interactive tool that:
- Accepts any type of waste item from the user  
- Checks whether it belongs to dry waste or wet waste  
- Displays the correct category with a clear message  

## 🧠 How the Program Works
1. User enters the name or type of waste (example: “paper”, “banana peel”, “plastic”, “vegetable scraps”).  
2. The program compares the input with predefined lists of dry and wet waste.  
3. It prints:
   - *Dry Waste* → items like paper, plastic, cardboard, metal, glass  
   - *Wet Waste* → items like food scraps, fruit peels, tea/coffee waste  
4. If the item is not recognized, the program shows a helpful message.

## 🛠 Features
- Categorizes common household waste items  
- Handles upper/lowercase inputs  
- Can easily be expanded with more items  
- Beginner-friendly code logic  

## 🚀 Run the Program
Make sure Python 3 is installed, then run:
